    text: `When the circus tent opened for the grand show, everyone expected acrobats, lions, maybe even a unicycle-riding giraffe. Instead, the spotlight revealed… nothing. Just the empty ring and a single confused stagehand sweeping confetti like it was his life’s mission.
Moments later, a loud thud came from above. The ringmaster had climbed the tent ropes to make a dramatic entrance, but forgot he was afraid of heights. He refused to come down and started negotiating with gravity: “If I promise to stop eating funnel cakes, will you let me down gently?”
Meanwhile, a clown tried to distract the audience by juggling invisible balls. The audience politely clapped, unsure whether this was performance art or a cry for help.
Eventually, the ringmaster slid down by accident, bounced off a trampoline someone left there, and landed in the confetti pile. The crowd went wild. It was officially the best show of the season, even though none of it had been planned.`,

    text: `The Rainbow That Refused to Leave
One morning, a rainbow appeared over the hills and… just stayed there. All day. All night. Three days straight. The locals suspected it was broken, like someone forgot to turn it off.
A group of scientists came to investigate, poked it with sticks, and even took “rainbow samples,” which just turned out to be glitter. The rainbow, however, didn’t care — it simply hummed gently like a very smug, colorful cloud snake.
Children began using it as a slide. Dogs barked at it. One grandma hung her laundry on it because “it’s the perfect height.” Surprisingly, it worked.
On day five, the rainbow finally moved — only to shift two meters to the left. Everyone agreed this was enough progress for one week. The rainbow remains, probably reconsidering its life choices.`,

    text: `Legend said that the golden dragon corridor held many secrets. But the biggest secret was that it was way too long. Anyone who entered expecting treasure ended up walking for hours, regretting not bringing a snack.
Once, a brave adventurer marched through confidently, until he noticed the exact same dragon carving for the third time. He tried to convince himself this was symbolism, but eventually realized the hallway was looping. The dragons weren’t magical — they were just bad at interior design.
A maintenance worker finally revealed the truth: the architect had miscalculated the blueprint, so they extended the hallway by adding decorative arches until “it looked intentional.”
To escape, travelers just needed to walk backwards. Nobody thought of that until a toddler visiting on a school trip accidentally moonwalked her way out.`,

    text: `This volcano didn’t erupt because of tectonic activity; it erupted because it was dramatic. Every evening at sunset, it would bubble, rumble, and shoot sparks like it was trying to win a talent show.
Residents nearby tried reasoning with it. One even held up a scorecard that read “8/10 — nice enthusiasm.” The volcano responded by puffing out a perfectly shaped smoke heart. It was adorable and terrifying at the same time.
Lava flows were oddly polite, too. They avoided houses, only melting lawn gnomes for “artistic purposes.” The gnomes took it personally.
Eventually, the volcano calmed down after someone played soothing pan flute music. Turns out it wasn’t angry — it was just lonely. Now it erupts only on weekends, for fun.`,

    text: `The sandstone mesas had been standing quietly for centuries… until one morning a huge butte started sliding two meters to the right. Everyone panicked except the butte itself, which seemed almost proud of its new position.
Geologists rushed in, arguing whether this was erosion, magic, or the world’s laziest landslide. The butte continued shifting tiny amounts each day, like it was practicing choreography.
Tourists quickly fell in love with it, calling it “the dancing rock.” Someone even painted tiny shoes at the base. The butte didn’t object — if anything, it stood a little taller.
Eventually, after performing what looked suspiciously like a wiggly shimmy, the butte stopped. It had found its perfect angle for sunset selfies.`,

    text: `Deep in the forest, the plants weren’t ordinary — they whispered. Not in a spooky way, but in a “Did you see what that vine was wearing?” kind of way.
Explorers who entered the jungle reported hearing giggles, sighs, and the occasional sarcastic comment about their hiking boots. One fern even claimed to have “better hair than any human.”
The sunlight beams didn't help either — the plants treated them like spotlights, striking dramatic poses whenever possible. One orchid would faint on purpose just to get attention.
The funniest part? If anyone tried to take a photo, the plants immediately acted normal. The moment the camera lowered, they resumed judging everyone's outfits.`,

    image: require('../../assets/images/gigglelandstory7.png'),
    text: `Visitors to the ancient temple often felt they were being stared at. That’s because the statues were staring — not magically, but because the sculptor gave them unforgiving “I’m disappointed in you” expressions.
People whispered their secrets at the entrance hoping for wisdom, only to feel judged by stone eyebrows. A teenager confessed he hadn’t done homework in months, and the statues seemed to glare harder.
Tour guides tried to lighten the mood by putting sunglasses on the statues, but somehow that made everything worse. The statues looked like they were silently judging everyone’s music taste.
Eventually, a tourist brought a feather duster and cleaned the statues. They didn’t move, but the entire room suddenly felt… less passive-aggressive.`,

    text: `Everyone thought the buffalo herd was charging. In reality, they were late. Late for what? Nobody knew — not even the buffalo.
Witnesses claimed the herd had overslept and decided to sprint toward something that “felt important.” Dust clouds billowed dramatically behind them, which only added to the confusion.
One buffalo paused to sniff a cactus, remembered he was in a hurry, then galloped twice as fast. Another kept stopping to check if his fur looked good in the sunset.
Eventually, the herd reached the horizon, realized they forgot what they were rushing toward, and calmly walked back like nothing happened.`,

    text: `The little cottage in the enchanted woods was cozy, charming, and absolutely impossible to trust. Its windows flickered like it was winking. Its steps creaked words like “turn back” but not convincingly.
Travelers noticed runes glowing gently around it — not sinister, just showing off. The cottage liked attention. If someone ignored it, it would float an inch off the ground until someone reacted.
Inside, the furniture rearranged itself trying to “improve feng shui,” which resulted in absolute chaos. Once, a chair tried to align with the moon cycle and ended up upside-down.
Still, everyone who visited left with a warm feeling, like the cottage secretly cared. And maybe it did — as long as you complimented its curtains.`,

    text: `One morning, an explorer tried to walk down a path when the vines gently nudged him left. He followed… and ended up at a puddle. The vines swayed proudly anyway. Clearly, they believed puddles were underrated tourist attractions.
Flowers weren’t any better. They’d release tiny puffs of fragrance whenever someone got too close, as if saying, “Notice me! Compliment me!” One orchid even wilted theatrically when a hiker complimented a different flower first.
The funniest part was the sunlight beams. They would position themselves like spotlights, chasing the explorer around the clearing as if auditioning him for a jungle talent show. When he waved awkwardly, the entire forest rustled in applause.
Eventually, the traveler sat down, sighed, and said, “I’m just trying to eat my sandwich.” The plants immediately leaned in closer, eager to judge his choice of ingredients. The jungle wasn’t dangerous — just very, very nosy.`,
